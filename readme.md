# Blazor with .NET 6
1. EntityFramework Core (EF Core)
2. Creating Blazor Application
	- One DEMO for Server-Hosted App
		- appsettings.json
			- DB Connection String
			- Application Level Configuration Values e.g. JWT Secret
			- AzureAD Security Settings
			- WebApplication Builder with its 'Configuration' property will be used to read the Serttings in appsettings.json	
		- Program.cs
			- WebApplication Buidler
	- WebAssembly Application
		- WebAssemblyHostBuilder
			- Host class that is used to manage the Blazor WASM project execution in Browser using followng
				- Loading App level Configuration
					- Initializing DI Container
					- Using In-Memory Collections
					- The UI Rendering of component
					- Data Binding with UI
					- Events on UI
	- .cshtml, they are the Razor Views which will be executed on the server and will be responsible to act as a platform for rendering Blazor UI 
	- .razor, they are Blazor Component
	- Directives
		- @page: the directive for component so that it can be used for Routing. It is always a URL
		- @inject: for Dependency Injection
		- @using: to refer and load the namespace
		- @namespace: to define a namespace (IT iks default based on the folder strructure)
		- @addTagHelper: for Registring the Custom Tag Helper
3. Components
	- Usning Standard Components
			- InputText, InputNumber, InputCheck, InputRadio, InputSelect
			- EditForm
				- Mandatory for Form Elements e.g. InputComponent
				- Model
					- Used to bind the CLR Entity Object for Value Updates
					- OnValidSubmit
						- Submit the form with the Validation Evaluation loaded on UI Thread 
					- DataAnnotationValidator
						- USed to Evaluate the ASnnotation Validation Rules
					- ValidationSummary
						- Load the HTML UI for showing validation

			- ComponentBase as a Blase Class
				- Contain following Feature for Each Component
					- Property System
						- Properties for Data and Events	
					- Initialization
						- Default Data and Rendering of the Components
					- Lifecycle Methods
						- Rendering
						- PreRendering
						- StateChanges
				- Parameters
					- Data Properties accepted from the Parent Component
					- Used for Communication Across Component with Parent-Child Relationships
				- CascadeParameters
					- Data folw from Parent-to-each child and grand children in a UI Compositional Tree		 
	- When a new Razor Component file is added into the project, the file-name is itself is a 'CUSTOM-CONMPONENT-TAG'
		- It will be compiled as a Component and willbe used by the application 
						
		- Validations
		
		- Databinding
			- A Mechanism of Linkink a Data Memeber of the Component with UI Element
				- @bind-Value for all Input Elements
					- @bind-Value="The-DATA-MEMBER"
					- This will be a Two-Way Binding
					- @bind-Value, will invoke a default 'Keyup-Change' event (blur) on the Input element to update the data proeprty
				- @DATA-MEMBER-NAME
					- the One-Way binding from Component Code to UI
				- @event-name
					- An Event Binding
					- Bind the Method from the Component Code with the Event of UI Element Element
						- @onclick="@METHOD-NAME"
		- Routing
		- Authentication
		- Authorization
	- Using Re-Usable Components
		- Rules for Defining Re-Usable Components
			- MUST be generic as far as possible
			- MUST define parameters for the Communication toi accept data from Parent Component
				- All these parameters MUST be public property
				- This property MUST be decorated with 'Parameter' Attribute
			- MUST define Events or EventCallback to Emit Data to parent component
				- To Emit data from Child to parent, the Handler event MUST be Asynchronous 
		- Component Communication
			- Parent-Child Relationship
				- Parameters and Custom Events
			- State-Management aka Sessioning
				- Client-Side Data Storage
				- Handling Application State		
		- Auto-Navigate across Components using the 'NavigationManager' class
			- This is already registred in the WebHostBuilder as a Transient Object
			- This is the 'NavigateTo(COMPONENT-URL-TO-NAVIGATE)' method
	- Integration with Existing JavaScript Library or Framework (Used in case of Micro-FrontEnds)
		- IJSRuntime
			- Service that is used to integrate the JavaScript Object Model (JSOM) with Blazor
			- Has the Invoke feature for Invoking JavaScript into the Blazor Apps
			- Used to Expose the CSharp to JavaScript
			- Server-Hosted or the Blazor WASM the js file MUST be in wwwroot folder
			- In Server App: The JS file is loaded using _Layout.Cshtml befoer closing the Body tag
			- In WASM it will be used by index.html before the closing body tag 
		- Async Methods
			- InvokeAsync<T>("STRING-METHOD-NAME-FROM-JS-FILE", Arguments Array)
				- T is the Type used by thge method for Result returned from the JS method
				- The ' Arguments Array' will be JSON Serialized and will be provide to JSOM as a Comma-separated List of parameters
					- E.g. If JS methoid is add(x,y) and Agruments array as 100,200
						- x will be 100
						- y will be 200
			- InvokeVoidAsync()
				- The JS method that does not return any value	
		- Recommendations for Invoking JS in Blazor	
			- In Component create a Wrapper to invoke the JS Methods so that it becomes easy to buind them to UI
		- JSInvokableAttribute Class
			- Applied on the C# methods to expose them to JS
			- Used by dotnet Web Assembly Project
				- dotnet.x.x.x.js object model
					- window object of JSOM
						- Wrap call to CSharp method using 
							- DotNet.invokeMethodAsync("ASSEMBLY-NAME", "CSHARP-METHOD-NAME")
			- The Csharp method must be public static method that return a Task Object	
			- IMP***
				- When calling CSharp to JS, create a JS window level object, that will contains all Asycn Method those who will call CSharp method
	- Virtualization
		- Virtualization Component
			- A DOM or UI Generation Manager, that is used to optimize the DOM Rendering based on Data Volume by Providing the Virtical Scrolling integration of the Browser's DOM and hence the JSOM that calculated the Vericle scrolling to generate UI
				- USed Cases
					- rendering a Large Set of Data Item
					- Hide most of the part of rendered items
					- Aut-Calculate the Rendering Size and generate renderting on Demand (i.e. Scrolling Events)
			- Properties
				- Items
					- Get / Set the Fix Source
				- Context
					- The Object State that of whihc value used for Rendering the UI
				- ChildContent
					- Represent an ItemTemplate that will be used for Generating UI based on Scroll Events
					- This will be implicitely set
				- ItemContent
					- The Portion of the data that will be used in rendering
				- ItemSize
					- The UI and Data Rendering sizein pixel (default is 50pixel)
			- The Component Class  is
				- Virtualize<T>
					- T is the class, the data to be virtualize	
	- Explicit Value Change Events on InputXXXX Componnets e.g. InputText, InputSelect	
		- Modify the State of an InputSelect based on Change of other InputSelect (aka cascade Eventing with data updates)
		- Explicit Events with Input Components
			- ValueChanged
				- An event that is used to detect a Change event and execute a method that receive the changed value
			- Value
				- A Porperty of which value is updated based on the ValueChanged event
			- ValueExpression
				- A State of Input Component itself that will implicitely invoke 'StateChanged' event on the Input Componment and modify that Input Component when the ValueChanged event is raised on it  
				
	- Templates
	- Server-Side Communication

	- Using EntityFramework Core 6 (EF Core 6)
		- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) for .NET 5,6 Apps
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
			- Code-First and Database-First
				-  Database-First
					- USed in case of the Production Ready Database
						- Model Classes aka Entities with Relations and column Constraints are generated by code-generator
						- Start coding for CRUD immediately
						- Challenge
							- If Database Schema is changed, then the Model Generations MUST be done Again
				- Code-First
					- Application is designed from Scratch
					- Create Models, Set Relations, Apply Constraints in Code
						- IMP***: The Exact requirements MUST be KNOWN by Entity Creators (Developers)
					- USe the Fluent-API for Relatioships
						- One-to-One
						- One-to-Many
						- Many-to-Many
						- Table-Per-Hierarchy
					- Challenge
						- With Change Requirements, the Model MUST be Modified and the DB Migrations MUST be done explicitely
			- DbContext	
				- Manage Db Connection
				- Manage Entity-to-Table Mapping using DbSet class
				- Handle Entity Updates
				- Manage Database Transactions
			- DbSet<T>
				- Represent Entity-to-Table Mapping
				- T is Entity Class Mapped with Database Table of name T
				- DbSet is Cursor that contains RowSets in it (like SELECT query)
				- Track Entity Changes during Row Update and Delete Operations
			- EF Core Advantages
				- Default Async DB Operations (Recommended)
				- Interannly uses connection resileancy (Wait for Connection to DB, ConnectionOpenTime default to 20 Secondas )
				- Lazy-Loading of Data
				- Stored Procedure Mapping
				- SQL, MySQL,PostgreSQL, Sqlite, SQL Compact, In-Memory
				- Support for ComsmosDB Support (No-SQL)

			- Pseduo Code
				- Consider 'ctx' is an instance of DbContext and Employee is Entity Class and DbSet<Employee> is Employees
				- Read All Records
					- ctx.Employees.ToList() OR  ctx.Employees.ToListAsync()
				- Read Record Based on Primary Key
					- ctx.Employees.Find(EmpNo) OR ctx.Employees.FindAsync(EmpNo)
				- To Append New Record
					- Create an Instance of Employee Entity e.g. Emp
					- Set all Properties
					- Add the instance in DbSet
						- ctx.Employees.Add(Emp) OR ctx.Employees.AddAsync(Emp)
					- Add In Range (Multiple Employees)
						- ctx.Employees.AddRange(Employee Collection) OR ctx.Employees.AddRangeAsync(Employee Collection)
					- Commit Transaction
						- ctx.SaveChanges() OR ctx.SaveChangesAsync()
				- To Update Record
					- Find Reccord based on Primary Key
					- Update it
						- ctx.Update<Employee>(Updated Values)
					- Commit Transaction
				- To Delete Record
					- Find Record Based on Primary Key
					- ctx.Employees.Remove(Searched record)
					- Commit Transaction
		- Use dotnet CLI to Install Packages
			- dotnet add package [PACKAGE-NAME]
						
		- Generate Models (Entities) from Database Database-First
			- Install DOT Net CLI for EF Core in Global Scope
				- dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
			- Generate Models from DB
				- dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Connection-string" DB-PROVIDER -o [FOLEDR-PATH-TO-CREATE-MODEL-CLASSES (default is Models folder)]
				- e.g.
					- dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Company;Integrated Security=SSPI" Microsoft.EntityFramework.SqlServer	
					- dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Company;User Id=;Password=" Microsoft.EntityFramework.SqlServer	
		- ControllerBase
			- Base class for Cointroller in ASP.NET Core 
				- Evluates, Security, Filters, Action Methods, Exception, etc.
				- Evaluates, Routing, ModelState Validation
				- Generates Reponses
					- Ok() / OkResult() for Success
					- NotFound()
					- Conflict()
					- BadRequest()
					- .... and many more
			- Httprequest
				- Request
					- Request Type Get/Post/Put/Delete, URL Parameters, Headers, Body, etc.
			- HttpContext
				- A THread that represents an HTTP Channel 
				- Manage Application Middlweares
					- Middlewares are replacement of HttpModule and HttpHandler
					- Software Components that contains Custom Logic for Http Request to Execute
					- This contains Global level logic to be executed during request processing e.g.
					Errors, Loggers, Routing, Security, etc.
			- HttpResponse
				- Response
					- Response Header
						- STatus Code
						- Other Header Info
					- Resource
						- Body with HTML or JSON
						- Exception or Error Message
			- Middlewares Vs Filters
				- Middlewares are global to the Application
				- Filters are only for Controllers and Actions Method
				- IMP*** if you have exceptyion filter and exception Middleware, then Exception Filter will override the exceptoin middleware
				- RequestDelegate and HttpContext
					- RequestDelegate
						- Integrate the Middleware Logic into the HTTP Pipeline
							- Provides IApplicationBuilder contract
								- Use(), Run()
									- Use(), to integrate the Middleware into the Pipeline
									- Run(), to execute the miuddleware when a Situation occurres
							- UseMiddleware<T>() IApplicationBuilder extension method is uised for Registration and Running the middleware
								- T is theCustom Milddleware logic whihc is constructor injected using RequestDelegate
						- Requires an InvokeAsync(HttpContext) method
							- This method contains logic for Execution in Pipeline
					- Use-Cases
						- Custom Exception Handler
						- Logger
						- Custom Authentication and Authorization** (Verify the Need first)
						- Custom Static File Provider (ASP.NET Core MVC)
							- Custom File Manager for Encryptrio, Decryption, etc.

					- Singleton
						- The Object will live forever till the application is running
						- To Share data across Components 
					- Scopped
						- The Object will be lived for the complete Lifecycle of a Component and its children
						- For all heavy load objects those are constlier for instantiation e.g. HttpClient 
					- Transient
						- The object will be live only for the specific component
						- An object that is required only for lightweight operations
		- Inject Dependecnies
